&lt;p>The main issue with data quality can be attributed to ensuring that each patient has realistic health values charted for each simulated session at the bidet. An example of this, which we came across early in the process, was that some of our patients had temperatures in the low 60s/70s or in the 120s/130s range. At first, we saw it as a success that we were able to simulate abnormalities and sustained health data, but soon realized that the temperature values we were recording would mean that the patient was dead. To fix this small error, we consulted with our mentor, Dr. Mathura, about his insights from the medical field and looked at standard ranges for each health metric published by health officials.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data processing was mainly done using Python&amp;rsquo;s Pandas. Due to the initial data we collected on Kaggle, the data was in a CSV format that was read into a dataframe using Pandas. From there, we constructed the baseline data for the initial 6000 patients, given each piece of data that we had collected from Kaggle, and filling in the blanks with data that was in the normal range found within the individual health metrics. After we had the initial baseline for each patient, we simulated 28 days and two bathroom sessions for each patient to expand our dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When simulating the data for each patient, we started with their baseline entry in the data frame and added/subtracted the standard range at which one person should change in that particular health metric. This measure would continue for the rest of the entries using the previous one as the new baseline to determine future results. Within this effort, we also wanted to include abnormalities that we could potentially flag later in the process to detect heart failure. We achieved this by adding a 7% chance (using a randomizer) of abnormal change that would deviate from the normal standard range and double the range of an increase/decrease that can happen. An example of this in practice that I can share is weight. From our studies and talks with our mentors, the average person will experience a daily +7/-7 weight change, which is normal and expected. This would happen 93% of the time; however, the 7% chance would allow for a person to have a +14/-14 weight change, which would be abnormal. This way, while not with the same exact numbers, can be seen for each health metric.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first way that we explored the data was by charting the differences with patients across the different health metrics over days, weeks, and the month( we did this using matplotlib) to guarantee that we had normal and abnormal data mixed in that we can use to flag for heart failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main goal of this project was to detect heart failure, and with certainty that patient data wasn&amp;rsquo;t static and not drastically abnormal (people can slip up from time to time), we charted forward to flagging health metrics that could lead to heart failure. With the fully completed database, the way that we flagged health metrics for each patient was by using both a personal and public range to determine if the metric is normal, risky (yellow), or dangerous (red). For the personal range, we added the range of all the entries of the health metric for that patient, and for the public range, we used the normal/healthy ranges given by health experts. We looked at how much the patient deviated from both ranges, and if it was less than one, it was normal/healthy. If it was between 1 and 3, then it would be categorized as risky and given a yellow flag or warning. Finally, if it was above 3, then it would be flagged with red, and the patient would have a dangerous health metric.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Assessment</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-health-monitoring/data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-health-monitoring/data/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our initial dataset for this proof of concept was acquired from Kaggle. This data includes height, weight and pulse oximetry. We synthesized the rest of the attributes (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and daily calories) by looking at the global normal ranges. And then we injected some anomalies into the dataset to help with analysis. Most of the data was synthesized since biomarker data is usually private and hard to access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-overview-and-examples">Data Overview and Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Each row of the dataset represents the data collected every time one of our hypothetical patients uses the smart toilet seat. It is sorted by date and contains synthetic data for one month from 03-01-2023 to 03-28-2023 for 630 patients assuming every patient uses the toilet seat twice a day. The patient.csv dataset contains the following parameters:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>patient_id&lt;/li>
&lt;li>date&lt;/li>
&lt;li>time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>length_of_time(sec)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>weight(lbs)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pulse_oximetry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>heart_rate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bp_sys&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bp_dia&lt;/li>
&lt;li>temperature&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Apart from this, we also created two other datasets:
-Patient demographic - contains information like age and sex of a patient
-Calories - to measure daily activity of a patient, this is a separate dataset since it is collected at the end of each day, and not a irregular intervals like the other parameters&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-accessibility">Data Accessibility&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We would like to upload our datasets to HIPAA compliant cloud database services like Amazon’s DynamoDB and S3 buckets. APIs will be used to perform CRUD operations on the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-formats">Data Formats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our data is tabular and in csv format.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-challenges">Data Challenges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The biggest challenge for our project was to synthesize data that appropriately represents the real world.We had to randomly generate biomarker values and then carefully inject anomalies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Technologies such as smart phones and smartwatches have provided people easy ways to monitor their health. Unfortunately, most of this data is incomplete, fragmented, and inconsistent, rendering it unusable in clinical settings. In order for the data to be clinically actionable and reimbursable as per remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM), it needs to be consistent and valid. How can we track a person’s health reliably, consistently, and unobtrusively in order to obtain clinically actionable data to provide patient-centered care? Enter the smart toilet seat, or as we like to call it, DataBidet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The primary motivation for this project is to provide patient-centered care. Many clinicians aim to cater to an individual’s specific health needs when making health decisions in prescribing care (Catalyst, 2017). Patient-centered care promotes patient engagement, leading to better health outcomes and eventually, personalized medicine. Furthermore, with the DataBidet, biodata such as weight, temperature, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure would be collected every time a person sat down to use the toilet. Unlike a smartwatch, which is easily forgotten and inaccurate, a toilet is a consistent part of everyday life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem-for-the-semester">Problem for the Semester&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal is to create a software-as-a-service data pipeline for collecting health biomarkers via an instrumented toilet seat. This clinical data management system (CDMS) will enable collecting clinical-grade, high-quality, curated, and consistent data capture that meets NIH and FDA standards of clinical utility. This system will streamline data collection, management, and reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-the-art">State of the Art&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Toto launched one of the first smart toilets in the early 2000s, but it was discontinued due to low demand (Baggaley, 2019). Since then, there has been interest in developing a health monitoring smart toilet from the University of Massachusetts and even Bill Gates (Spencer, 2023; Baggaley, 2019). However, no smart toilet has yet become mainstream, likely due to high costs and barriers to regulation. While our team recognizes these challenges, we are focusing on the software side of the product.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="design-and-approach">Design and Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, the team will generate dummy data using a variety of datasets found on Kaggle as well as looking at average human ranges while adding outliers. Once we have a comprehensive dataset comprised of multiple entries per patient with qualities that potentially could be measured through a smart toilet seat, we will upload the data to a database that is secure and HIPAA compliant. Next, we will choose one patient on which to perform analytics and create a dashboard of what a clinician might see when monitoring a patient’s data from the DataBidet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-case-scenario">Use Case Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>DataBidet primary users would be people with chronic illnesses. People with chronic illnesses need to monitor their health more than a healthy person, so a smart toilet seat that collects reliable data would be useful for them and their doctors. Ideally, the DataBidet would be a regular gadget for people to have, similar to the Apple Watch or Fitbit. It would then be able to flag when a persons’ health changes or has any concerns. For example, if a patient suddenly gains weight, has an elevated heart rate, and has a change in blood pressure without changing their diet or exercise, it could be an indication of heart failure. The best use case scenario would be for the DataBidet to identify illnesses before people are even aware they are sick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="desired-outcomes-and-benefits">Desired Outcomes and Benefits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The desired outcome would be to create a data collection, transmission and storage pipeline, analytics and report generation platform to produce clinically actionable, IRB and regulatorily approved, and reimbursable reports. We would also like to create a system or platform that could collect, analyze, and distribute data to the end users. Future work would include building the actual hardware for the toilet seat and integrating the collected data with other health monitoring systems such as step counters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our system and model of flagging data works as expected given the parameters we gave. The next steps will be to go from working with static data to real time data that is constantly fed into the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="discussion-of-findings">Discussion of Findings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We were able to flag risks of heart failure with the patinets in our database, but the true results will come when we are able to connect red flags into patient outcomes with heart failure. With this addtional metric, we would able to fine tune our flagging system and provide the most reliable system for detecting heart failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One limitation is that our dashboard and website is not yet fully functional. We are working on connecting our data to the dashboard so that it can be viewed in real time. Another limitation of our project is that we are currently working with dummy data that we got from Kaggle and that we generated ourselves. Because we have not yet worked with data from real patients, we do not yet know whether or not our method for flagging anomalies needs to be tweaked. Although we are still working on the flagging system, this is also the most promising part of our project because it is a clear and easy way for both clinicians and patients to see anomalies in their health data. Future work will include checking to see if our flagging system is accurate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
