This page contains key sections of the **Final Report** for the project focused on results to date.  It should be no more than 2 pages long.  An initial draft can be created at any point during the project, and can be refined as the project progresses.

## System and Model Performance

Show the performance of the best system and model(s) developed, showing clearly the performance metrics and improvements over the baseline system as appropriate.  Create visualizations that show clearly these results.

## Discussion of Findings

Offer a discussion of the main findings using the system developed. Put the results in the context of the original problem statement and the questions that were posed.

Discuss any unexpected results, and potential explanations.

Enumerate (ideally in bullets) the most important findings, and their impact on your project goals.

## Limitations and Future Work

One limitation is that our dashboard and website is not yet fully functional. We are working on connecting our data to the dashboard so that it can be viewed in real time. Another limitation of our project is that we are currently working with dummy data that we got from Kaggle and that we generated ourselves. Because we have not yet worked with data from real patients, we do not yet know whether or not our method for flagging anomalies needs to be tweaked. Although we are still working on the flagging system, this is also the most promising part of our project because it is a clear and easy way for both clinicians and patients to see anomalies in their health data. Future work will include checking to see if our flagging system is accurate.
