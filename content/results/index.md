## System and Model Performance

Our system and model of flagging data works as expected given the parameters we gave. The next steps will be to go from working with static data to real time data that is constantly fed into the database.

## Discussion of Findings

We were able to flag risks of heart failure with the patinets in our database, but the true results will come when we are able to connect red flags into patient outcomes with heart failure. With this addtional metric, we would able to fine tune our flagging system and provide the most reliable system for detecting heart failure. 

## Limitations and Future Work

One limitation is that our dashboard and website is not yet fully functional. We are working on connecting our data to the dashboard so that it can be viewed in real time. Another limitation of our project is that we are currently working with dummy data that we got from Kaggle and that we generated ourselves. Because we have not yet worked with data from real patients, we do not yet know whether or not our method for flagging anomalies needs to be tweaked. Although we are still working on the flagging system, this is also the most promising part of our project because it is a clear and easy way for both clinicians and patients to see anomalies in their health data. Future work will include checking to see if our flagging system is accurate.
