It should be no more than 2-3 pages long. It can be drafted in the first two weeks of the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the use of the data is better understood.\nData Overview and Examples Give a brief description of the data provided for this project, what it represents, how it was collected, and why it may help address the problem you are tackling. Discuss if you will be using all the data or only some subset of it for the project. Consider possible additional data that may be publicly available in the open Web that might complement the data that you are given.\nData Accessibility Summarize how the data can be accessed. For example, data may be available for download in files, or accessible through an API, or can be queried from a database. Mention any restrictions in accessing the data, for example if it is sensitive data that can only accessed with special permission.\nData Formats Describe briefly the formats of the data. Common data formats include CSV, JSON, XML, shapefiles, or any other specific formats relevant to your website.\nData Challenges Summarize why analyzing this data will be challenging. This may include issues like data heterogeneity, data size, and any pre- or post-processing needs. Explain some ideas for how these challenges could be addressed.\nData Visualizations and Highlights Including a visualization is a simple way to show something interesting about the data. Perhaps the visualizations could simply highlight the size, distribution, and other simple statistical characteristics of the data.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696363288,"objectID":"be566fdb6f0fa08cfea50d77a89a6b5a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-health-monitoring/data/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-health-monitoring/data/","section":"","summary":"Data Assessment Document that gives an overview of the data used for the project.","tags":null,"title":"Data Assessment","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Technologies such as smart phones and smartwatches have provided people easy ways to monitor their health. Unfortunately, most of this data is incomplete, fragmented, and inconsistent, rendering it unusable in clinical settings. In order for the data to be clinically actionable and reimbursable as per remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM), it needs to be consistent and valid. How can we track a person’s health reliably, consistently, and unobtrusively in order to obtain clinically actionable data to provide patient-centered care? Enter the smart toilet seat, or as we like to call it, DataBidet.\nMotivation The primary motivation for this project is to provide patient-centered care. Many clinicians aim to cater to an individual’s specific health needs when making health decisions in prescribing care (Catalyst, 2017). Patient-centered care promotes patient engagement, leading to better health outcomes and eventually, personalized medicine. Furthermore, with the DataBidet, biodata such as weight, temperature, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure would be collected every time a person sat down to use the toilet. Unlike a smartwatch, which is easily forgotten and inaccurate, a toilet is a consistent part of everyday life.\nProblem for the Semester The goal is to create a software-as-a-service data pipeline for collecting health biomarkers via an instrumented toilet seat. This clinical data management system (CDMS) will enable collecting clinical-grade, high-quality, curated, and consistent data capture that meets NIH and FDA standards of clinical utility. This system will streamline data collection, management, and reporting.\nState of the Art Toto launched one of the first smart toilets in the early 2000s, but it was discontinued due to low demand (Baggaley, 2019). Since then, there has been interest in developing a health monitoring smart toilet from the University of Massachusetts and even Bill Gates (Spencer, 2023; Baggaley, 2019). However, no smart toilet has yet become mainstream, likely due to high costs and barriers to regulation. While our team recognizes these challenges, we are focusing on the software side of the product.\nDesign and Approach First, the team will generate dummy data using a variety of datasets found on Kaggle as well as looking at average human ranges while adding outliers. Once we have a comprehensive dataset comprised of multiple entries per patient with qualities that potentially could be measured through a smart toilet seat, we will upload the data to a database that is secure and HIPAA compliant. Next, we will choose one patient on which to perform analytics and create a dashboard of what a clinician might see when monitoring a patient’s data from the DataBidet.\nUse Case Scenario DataBidet primary users would be people with chronic illnesses. People with chronic illnesses need to monitor their health more than a healthy person, so a smart toilet seat that collects reliable data would be useful for them and their doctors. Ideally, the DataBidet would be a regular gadget for people to have, similar to the Apple Watch or Fitbit. It would then be able to flag when a persons’ health changes or has any concerns. For example, if a patient suddenly gains weight, has an elevated heart rate, and has a change in blood pressure without changing their diet or exercise, it could be an indication of heart failure. The best use case scenario would be for the DataBidet to identify illnesses before people are even aware they are sick.\nDesired Outcomes and Benefits The desired outcome would be to create a data collection, transmission and storage pipeline, analytics and report generation platform to produce clinically actionable, IRB and regulatorily approved, and reimbursable reports. We would also like to create a system or platform that could collect, analyze, and distribute data to the end users. Future work would include building the actual hardware for the toilet seat and integrating the collected data with other health monitoring systems such as step counters.\nCitations Baggaley, K.
